# Apartments project - Rails API

This app allows one user to log in to create, update, view, and delete many apartment preferences around the world. On the Rails API, the included actions are written in cURL scripts as Index, Show, Create, Update, and Destroy.

# Development & Problem Solving Process

- I was able to use my notes to get started on the curl scripts, although I wasn't initially understanding what each word's true function really was. Once it became clear why certain values were or weren't required in a respective curl script, the efficiency of my coding improved greatly. I hadn't made the connection that the words in red in the curl script file are essentially the values you need to define in terminal. Once this clicked, proceding through the scripts was relatively simple.

- As with the front end, I followed the recommended schedule for the vast majority of my back end work, which created many small victories along the way, keeping morale high.

- While Google and Stack Overflow provided some help on the front end, I found that my notes and my classmates' posted issues were far more helpful in solving back end problems.

# Unsolved Problems

- I believe that my API technically meets the required specifications, although I certain have set a goal for myself to be able to more seamlessly navigate heroku's commands from the terminal, as well as the rails migrate commands. I see the value that these bring to a project, and want to use them to their fullest potential moving forward.

- Better understanding why the code is written exactly as it is in my apartments controller would also be a great help moving forward. While I'm pleased that it works, I want to be able to understand the code well enough to describe each line's use and necessity to someone else.
