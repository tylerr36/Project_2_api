# Apartment and car project - Rails API

This app allows one user to log in to create, update, view, and delete many apartment and car preferences. On the Rails API, the included actions are written in cURL scripts as Index, Show, Create, Update, and Destroy.

# Development & Problem Solving Process

- I was able to use my notes to get started on the curl scripts, although I wasn't initially understanding what each word's true function really was. Once it became clear why certain values were or weren't required in a respective curl script, the efficiency of my coding improved greatly. I hadn't made the connection that the words in red in the curl script file are essentially the values you need to define in terminal. Once this clicked, proceding through the scripts was relatively simple.

- When I added cars to the back end on my second submission, I saw the tremendous benefit of practice and repetition, as the entire process took less than 1.5 hours, whereas the same tasks took about 10 hours when initially setting up my back end.

- As with the front end, I followed the recommended schedule for the vast majority of my back end work, which created many small victories along the way, keeping morale high.

- While Google and Stack Overflow provided some help on the front end, I found that my notes, previous work, and my classmates' posted issues were far more helpful in solving back end problems.

# Unsolved Problems

- I believe that my API technically meets the required specifications, although I still have the goal of being able to more seamlessly navigate heroku's commands from the terminal, as well as the commands involved with rails and migration. I see the value that these bring to a project, and want to use them to their fullest potential moving forward.

- Adding cars to the back end after successfully passing my first submission with apartments only was quite easy, as I was able to clearly see where the two should and shouldn't be coded the same. Having said that, I still cannot comfortably describe exactly what each command is doing, and why it is or isn't necessary. I'd like to get to a point where I could describe every line's purpose in detail.
